# Mod.io Manager
## !! REMOVE YOUR IN-GAME MOD MENU MODS !!
you want to **UNSUBSCRIBE FROM ALL MODS** before using this mod, as the in-game mod.io menu uses a separate directory and system and will interfere with this one.

## What does it do / Why does it do
An alternate modlist solution that allows you to share modlist with others. mod.io does not support sharing modlist (not just core keeper but the platform in general), aside from sharing zip files and telling everyone to download the mods manually *every version update for any of the mods*. 

The goal is to use this mod to leverage existing launchers (such as r2modman or Gale) to manage mod.io mods each version in a form of modpacks. for usage, see configs.
